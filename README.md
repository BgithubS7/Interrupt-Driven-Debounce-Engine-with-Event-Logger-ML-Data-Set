# Interrupt-Driven-Debounce-Engine-And-Event-Logger(with ML-Data-Set)
##ðŸ“– Overview

This project implements a debounce engine for push-button interrupts, with an integrated event logger for dataset generation.
Instead of using a voltage regulator or transistor as the input source, a push button is used to simulate noisy signals and debounce logic.

The collected event data is structured into a dataset suitable for machine learning pipelines, enabling training/testing of models on real-world hardware events.
