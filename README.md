# Interrupt Debounce Engine & Event Logger (with ML Dataset)

## üìñ Overview
This project implements a **debounce engine** for push-button interrupts, paired with an **event logger** for structured dataset generation.  

A push button is used to simulate the noisy transitions typically seen with mechanical switches, transistors, or voltage regulators. The debounce logic filters out spurious edges, while the event logger records reliable press/release events along with timing information.  

The logged data is formatted into a dataset suitable for **machine learning workflows**, enabling training and validation of models on real-world hardware signals.
